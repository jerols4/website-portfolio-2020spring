## Readme

This is a website I created as part of my Composing Digital Media class. It was built to show off my hobby: photography. With it, you are able to easily naviagte to learn more about the website and view different photography portfolios. It allows me to share the work I am most proud of in my hobby and hopefully reach a wider audience in doing so. Additionally, the creation of this website also helped me learn a lot about web page design. I was able to learn more about layout, design, typography, responsiveness, and many other elements of web design. The website is created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript from scratch (except for a few tutorials I followed). My biggest takeaway from this project was on the CSS side of things, since I only had a little bit of CSS experience prior. I gained a lot of experience toward responsive design, flexbox, and typography, and I hope to continue gaining experience in my career.
