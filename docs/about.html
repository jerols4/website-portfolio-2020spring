					<h1>Photos by Jeremy Olin</h1>
					<p>Hello, I am Jeremy Olin! I'm a student of Computer Science at the University of Pittsburgh, and when I'm not working on schoolwork, one of my favorite
					hobbies is photography. Although I enjoy a wide variety of photography, my favorite style is street photography, and it's the type of photography I hope to get best at. I recently studied abroad in Prague, Czech Republic, and while there I was able to work a lot on honing my photography skills! I made this website to show off some of the projects that I am most proud of, as well as to show off the website design skills I learned throughout my education. If you wish to view the source code of this website, it is available <a href="https://github.com/jerols4/website-portfolio-2020spring">here</a>. I wanted to make this website as minimalist as possible stylistically, which meant limiting the colors, effects, and content on the website. That being said, everything is responsive and easy to navigate. I hope you enjoy the pictures!</p>
